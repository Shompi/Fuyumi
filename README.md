# Fuyumi Aoi

_My first JavaScript proyect, a Discord bot, the one that gave me so much knowledge about how JS works._

### What is this repository for? ###

_To maintain version control over Fuyumi's development, plus it is easier for me to maintain, improve and update her code, also to accept suggestions, resolve issues, etc._

### Where can I read the documentation? ###

_Fuyumi itself doesn't have a documentation (besides the one showing the commands inside Discord.) but Im leaving the documentation for some of the packages that Fuyumi is most dependent:_
